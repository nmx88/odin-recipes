    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic Italian pasta dish featuring a rich, slow-simmered meat sauce.
      The key to an authentic Bolognese is patience, allowing the flavours of
      the meat, tomatoes, wine, and milk to meld together into a deep, hearty
      sauce that clings perfectly to spaghetti.
