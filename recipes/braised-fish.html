    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cá Kho Tộ is a quintessential Vietnamese home-cooked meal. Catfish or
      salmon is braised in a clay pot with a caramel sauce made from fish sauce,
      sugar, and coconut water. The result is an incredible sweet, salty, and
      savoury flavour with incredibly tender fish. It's typically served with
      steamed rice and vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>500g catfish steaks or salmon</li>
      <li>4 tbsp fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 shallot, sliced</li>
      <li>1 chili pepper, sliced (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut water or juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>Spring onions</li>
      <li>Oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        In a clay pot or deep skillet, heat the sugar over medium heat until it
        melts and turns into a golden-brown caramel. Be careful not to burn it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly add the fish sauce, coconut water, and regular water (be careful
        as it may splatter). Stir until the caramel dissolves. Add the garlic,
        shallot, and chili.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the fish steaks to the pot. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce
        the heat to low. Cover and let it braise for 20-30 minutes, spooning the
        sauce over the fish occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sauce should be reduced and slightly thickened. Garnish with black
        pepper and chopped spring onions. Serve immediately with plenty of
        steamed jasmine rice.
