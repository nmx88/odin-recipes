        Cá Kho Tộ is a quintessential Vietnamese home-cooked meal. Catfish or
        salmon is braised in a clay pot with a caramel sauce made from fish
        sauce, sugar, and coconut water. The result is an incredible sweet,
        salty, and savoury flavour with incredibly tender fish. It's typically
        served with steamed rice and vegetables.

        <li class="recipeSteps">
          In a clay pot or deep skillet, heat the sugar over medium heat until
          it melts and turns into a golden-brown caramel. Be careful not to burn
          it.
        </li>
        <li class="recipeSteps">
          Quickly add the fish sauce, coconut water, and regular water (be
          careful as it may splatter). Stir until the caramel dissolves. Add the
          garlic, shallot, and chili.
        </li>
        <li class="recipeSteps">
          Add the fish steaks to the pot. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then
          reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it braise for 20-30 minutes,
          spooning the sauce over the fish occasionally.
        </li>
        <li class="recipeSteps">
          The sauce should be reduced and slightly thickened. Garnish with black
          pepper and chopped spring onions. Serve immediately with plenty of
          steamed jasmine rice.
